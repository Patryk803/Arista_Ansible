### Here I am trying to use assert on the file which was saved

- name: Take global command
  hosts: S3
  connection: local
  gather_facts: no
  vars_files:
    - /home/patryk/Arista_Ansible/credentials.yaml

  vars_prompt:
    - name: NEXT_HOP
      prompt: "Please enter the IP of the Next HOP"
      private: no

  tasks:
  - name: Add default route
    eos_config:
      provider:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ USERNAME }}"
        password: "{{ DEVICE_PASSWORD }}"
        use_ssl: no
        authorize: yes
        transport: cli
      lines:
        - "ip route 0.0.0.0/0 {{ NEXT_HOP }}"

  - name: INPUT SHOW COMMAND TO DEVICES
    eos_command:
        commands: "show run"
        provider:
          host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
          username: "{{ USERNAME }}"
          password: "{{ DEVICE_PASSWORD }}"
          use_ssl: no
          authorize: yes
          transport: cli
    register: print_output

  - name: OUTPUT SHOW COMMAND to SCREEN
    debug:
        msg: "{{ print_output.stdout_lines }}"

  - name: OUTPUT SHOW COMMAND to FILE
    copy: content="{{ print_output.stdout[0] }}" dest="./output/{{ inventory_hostname }}.txt"

  - name: Get the whole config FILE
    command: cat ./output/{{ inventory_hostname }}.txt
    register: postcheck

  - name: Assert that the config was pushed succesfully
    assert:
       that:
          - "'ip route 0.0.0.0/0 {{ NEXT_HOP }}' in postcheck.stdout_lines"
       success_msg: "Yes it has been pushed"
       fail_msg: "It's not there!"
